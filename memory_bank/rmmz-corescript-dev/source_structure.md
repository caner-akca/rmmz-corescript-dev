# RPG Maker MZ CoreScript - Source Code Structure

The source code is organized into different modules based on functionality:

## Main Directories

- **rmmz_core**: Core functionality and base classes
- **rmmz_managers**: Game and resource management classes
- **rmmz_objects**: Game object classes (characters, events, etc.)
- **rmmz_scenes**: Scene classes (battle, map, menu, etc.)
- **rmmz_sprites**: Visual representation classes
- **rmmz_windows**: UI window classes

This modular structure allows for easier navigation and modification of specific game components. The original source code has been segmented into individual files by object, making it easier to understand and extend the engine's functionality.
