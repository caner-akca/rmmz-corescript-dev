## Implementation Priorities

For each phase, focus on the following priorities:

1. **Correctness**: Ensure data structures match RPG Maker MZ requirements
2. **Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with core RPG Maker MZ functionality
3. **Flexibility**: Build systems that can adapt to different game styles
4. **Performance**: Optimize for generation speed and memory usage
5. **Usability**: Create clear interfaces and documentation

## Technical Debt Management

Identify and manage the following potential areas of technical debt:

1. **File Format Compatibility**: RPG Maker MZ may update file formats
2. **Plugin Integration**: Community plugins may require special handling
3. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Complex generation may need optimization
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and recovery
5. **Documentation**: Keeping documentation in sync with implementation

## Testing Strategy

Implement the following testing approach:

1. **Unit Tests**: For individual components and functions
2. **Integration Tests**: For component interactions
3. **System Tests**: End-to-end generation tests
4. **Performance Tests**: Benchmarking generation speed and resource usage
5. **Validation Tests**: Ensuring generated content is playable

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 1 implementation with project setup
2. Create regular checkpoints to validate progress
3. Prioritize core functionality over advanced features
4. Use incremental testing to validate each component
5. Document as you build to maintain knowledge base
